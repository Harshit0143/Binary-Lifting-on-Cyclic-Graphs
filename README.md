# Binary Lifting on Cyclic Graphs
* Solution to CSES problem Planet Queries 2: https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1160
* We are implementing ```Binary Lifting``` on a graph given that each vertex has an ```out-degree``` exactly 1. 
* Thereby, we'll implement other functions like ```kth ancestor``` and ```distance``` between nodes.
